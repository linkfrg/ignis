# Simple bar

<img src="simple-bar.png"/>

This example demonstrates a simple bar.
Place ``config.py`` and ``style.css`` in the ``~/.config/ignis/`` directory.

**Dependencies:**
```
dart-sass
```


> [!NOTE]
> Currently fully supported compositors are Hyprland and Niri (workspaces, window title
> and keyboard layout). Under other compositors, the bar will not display those elements.
